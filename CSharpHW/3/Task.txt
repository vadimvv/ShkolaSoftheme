1. Create console application which gets user's birth date and returns his Age and Zodiac sign. Please use recursion for birth date validation.
   Application should accept date only in the following format: DD/MM/YYYY. In case if the format is incorrect the application should ask user to provide birth date again.
2. Create WPF application with the same functionality + display the picture of specified Zodiac sign.
